# Entertainment-smart-contracts

## Components
- Genesis -> custom ERC-721 that could only be purchased by members of a whitelist. This ERC-721 could evolve changing its appearance depending on the participation in the community.
- Main Experience -> custom ERC-721 that only genesis members could buy.
- Club options ->ERC-721 customised which could only be acquired by genesis members, but could be sold on secondary markets (Opensea)
- Art&Collectibles - >ERC-721 custom token that could be purchased by those who had redeemed their NFT from Main Experience and club options
- OE token -> ERC-20 custom token that could be purchased on the marketplace or by yielding the Genesis. With this token you could buy Club Options or
- Art&Collectibles. The price of this token is linked to the price of the dollar through an oracle.
- Treasury -> Smart Contract where Genesis members could make proposals about the future of the community. In this SC funds could be deposited to make investments.
